            <h2>Who are we!</h2>
            <p>NXT Museum is the first museum in the Netherlands dedicated to new media art.
                We focus on art that uses modern tools to embody contemporary times.
                We believe that the tools used in artistic expression reflect the era we live in.
                That makes them the perfect means to understand contemporary complexity, allowing us to recognize our reality.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                NXT Museum, founded by the young entrepreneur Merel van Helsdingen, exhibits large-scale art installations,
                developed through interdisciplinary collaborations between established and emerging artists, designers, technicians, musicians, and scientists.

            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>It is our mission to enable new and next iterations of creative expression.
                Everything we do, desire, and fear directly relates to the future.
                It is one of the most fascinating concepts for the human mind. An exciting source of inspiration that raises endless questions.
                Nowadays, these questions are more important and complex than ever.
                What's next? We don't know, but we are endlessly curious to explore together.

        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>We really enjoyed our visit. It was a very rainy day and it took us a while to walk here,
            but it was definitely worth the journey. We left our coats in the free wardrobe and spent a few hours immersing ourselves in the activities of the NXT museum using the free audio guide.
            We liked the museum's approach to sharing facts but also inviting the audience to think and challenge viewpoints and consensus. We were hooked on the introductory message explaining the concept.
            Lots of details and activities throughout the ages - excellent. We didn't really like the last modern part - but that's our taste and not a criticism - form your own opinion.
            All the staff we encountered were very friendly and happy to help - great location and would recommend.</p>

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>It was a small museum and had a nice history, but you wanted more.
            It seemed like there was much more history to tell about Amsterdam.
            I love history, and unfortunately, this museum couldn't capture my interest at all.</p>
